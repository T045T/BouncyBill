BouncyBill is a BlackBerry PlayBook application written using Adobe AIR that splits a bill between multiple users.
It features a natural and fluent user interface (thanks in no small part to [Tweener](http://code.google.com/p/tweener/)) that is still unlike anything else on the PlayBook, even after almost a year of availability on BlackBerry AppWorld.

However, it also still has some bugs because a license to Adobe's Flash Builder is prohibitively expensive.
As such, I'm putting this on Github to see what people will do with it. Have fun, guys!

(The last release of BouncyBill can be downloaded for free from the [AppWorld](http://appworld.blackberry.com/webstore/content/35116/?lang=en)).
